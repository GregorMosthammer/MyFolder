		<h1 id="mg">Mindgame</h1>
		<h3 id="mg1">Information</h3>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/Mindgame-2004-poster.jpg">
		<p>Mind Game is a 2004 Japanese animated feature film based on Robin Nishi's Japanese comic of the same name. It was planned, produced and primarily animated by Studio 4°C and adapted and directed by Masaaki Yuasa in his directorial debut, with chief animation direction and model sheets by Yūichirō Sueyoshi, art direction by Tōru Hishiyama and groundwork and further animation direction by Masahiko Kubo.
		It is unusual among features other than anthology films in using a series of disparate visual styles to tell one continuous story. As Yuasa commented in a Japan Times interview, "Instead of telling it serious and straight, I went for a look that was a bit wild and patchy. I think that Japanese animation fans today don't necessarily demand something that's so polished. You can throw different styles at them and they can still usually enjoy it."
		The film received a cult audience and was well received, winning multiple awards worldwide, and has been praised by directors Satoshi Kon and Bill Plympton. Allegedly, according to Tekkonkinkreet director Michael Arias, there was consideration for a release of the film on R1 DVD but it fell through. The film is now available to stream on Netflix in Australia as of 2016.</p>

		<h3 id="mg3">Plot!</h3>
		<p>Nishi is a 20-year-old loser with dreams of becoming a comic book artist. One late evening he runs into his childhood crush, Myon, on the subway. Nishi declares he has always loved her, but she tells him she is due to marry someone else.
		They go to her father's yakitori restaurant, and see Myon's father and her elder sister Yan (who runs the restaurant). Two yakuza gangsters enter. They are looking for Myon's father, who seduced and stole Atsu's girlfriend, and now hides cowering behind a corner. 
		As Atsu threatens Myon with a gun, Ryo steps in and tries to punch Atsu, but instead gets knocked out.  The gun goes off when Nishi suddenly moves, thus killing him instantly. The senior Yakuza, offended by Atsu's lack of control, shoots him dead, and then nonchalantly orders dinner.
		Meanwhile, Nishi is in some sort of limbo where he encounters a being whose physical image changes every fraction of a second, Kami-sama. Kami-sama directs Nishi to walk into a red portal where he will disappear, but at the last moment Nishi runs for the opposite blue portal in order to return to life. Kami-sama becomes impressed by Nishi's sheer will to live, and so lets him escape.
		Nishi returns to the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo behind. They speed off, followed by the massed yakuzas, jump over a bridge and disappear in an enormous whale that jumps up.</p><button><a href="#Top">To Top</a></button>

Among them is Travis (Brody), a proud anti-war protestor, and Michael Barris (Whitaker), a 42-year-old man who still lives with his domineering mother. After interviews measuring responses to various scenes of violence are conducted, a chosen 26 are driven to an isolated building set up as a prison and split into 6 guards and 20 prisoners. Travis is assigned to be a prisoner, Barris as a guard. Basic rules are outlined: prisoners must eat, and fully consume, 3 meals a day; there will be 30 minutes of rec daily; prisoners must remain within designated areas. The guards in turn must ensure prisoners obey the rules, and deal with transgressions commensurately within 30-minutes.Archaleta stresses that the experiment will end immediately at the first sign of violence or quitting. If they manage to follow the rules for two weeks, each man will be paid $14,000.</p><button><a href="#Top">To Top</a></button>
